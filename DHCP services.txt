***What is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

->DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses and 
other network settings to devices on a network. This removes the need to manually configure
 IP addresses on each device.

-----------DHCP servcies------

 1. DHCP Server Installation & Configuration
Service Goal:
Set up a DHCP server (Windows/Linux) to automate IP address distribution.

Includes:

-Installing DHCP role (Windows Server)
-Enabling DHCP service (Linux: isc-dhcp-server, dnsmasq)
-Basic service testing on client devices

2. Scope Creation & Management
Service Goal:
Define IP pools (scopes) for different network segments.

Includes:

-Setting start & end IP range
-Defining subnet mask, default gateway, DNS
-Lease duration configuration
-Multiple scopes for different VLANs/subnets

3. IP Reservation Setup
Service Goal:
Assign fixed IPs to specific devices using MAC address.

Use Case:

Printers, VoIP phones, servers

Includes:

-Mapping MAC â†’ IP
-Ensuring no duplicate assignment
-Adding reservation descriptions

 4. Exclusion Range Configuration
Service Goal:
Exclude IPs from the assignable range to avoid conflicts.

Use Case:

-Manual IPs assigned to firewalls, servers, CCTV NVRs, etc.

 5. DHCP Logging and Monitoring
Service Goal:
Track IP assignments, detect conflicts, and monitor usage.

Tools:

-Windows Event Viewer logs
-Linux syslog (/var/log/syslog)
-SNMP or third-party tools (PRTG, SolarWinds)
