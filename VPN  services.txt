**what is VPN
->VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a secure connection method that allows users or systems to access 
private networks and share data remotely through public networks (like the internet) as if they were
directly connected to the private network.

**How VPN Works:
1>The VPN client (user device) connects to a VPN server.
2>A secure encrypted tunnel is created between the device and the server.
3>All internet or network traffic goes through this encrypted tunnel.
4>Your real IP address is hidden and replaced by the VPN serverâ€™s IP.


**VPN Encryption:
->Data is encrypted (scrambled) so hackers or ISPs can't read it.
->Common protocols used:
      - OpenVPN
      - L2TP/IPSec
      - IKEv2
      - WireGuard
      - SSTP
