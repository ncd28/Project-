***What is SSH

->SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows you to securely connect to and control remote systems
 (like servers, computers) over a network. It encrypts all data sent between systems, including passwords.

- Secure Alternative to Telnet/FTP
- Client-Server Architecture
- Used for remote login, command execution, and secure file transfer

** SSH in Linux
How it works:
-Most Linux distros come with OpenSSH client pre-installed.
-SSH server (sshd) can be installed for remote access.


** SSH in Windows
 Options:
1>Built-in OpenSSH (since Windows 10/Server 2019)
2>Third-party apps: PuTTY, Bitvise, MobaXterm


Common Use-Cases (Linux & Windows)
Use Case	                Example
Remote login	            Admin logs in to manage server
File transfer	            Securely copy files using SCP or SFTP
Automation	            Run remote commands via SSH in scripts
Git over SSH	            Developers use SSH to access repositories
Remote troubleshooting	    Helpdesk/admins access user machines securely
