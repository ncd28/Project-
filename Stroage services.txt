as documents, applications, videos, databases, operating systems, and more.

--What is Storage in Linux?
->In Linux, storage refers to how the operating system manages disks, partitions, filesystems, and mounted drives 
so data can be saved, retrieved, and organized effectively.

**Types of Storage (Based on Functionality)
Type	                    Description	                                 Examples
Primary Storage	        Fast, volatile memory used for temporary data	RAM (Random Access Memory)
Secondary Storage	Non-volatile, used for permanent storage	HDDs, SSDs
Tertiary Storage	Used for archival/backup	                Tape Drives, Optical Discs
Cloud Storage	        Internet-based remote storage	                Google Drive, AWS S3
